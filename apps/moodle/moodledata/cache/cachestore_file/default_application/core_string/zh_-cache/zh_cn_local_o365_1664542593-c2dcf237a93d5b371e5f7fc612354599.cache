    Here's how to get set up:
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to Moodle as a administrator user that is not using the OpenID Connect authentication plugin.</li>
        <li>Disable the OpenID Connect authentication plugin in Moodle. (Use <a href="{$a}/admin/settings.php?section=manageauths">the authentication plugins administration page</a>.)</li>
        <li>Navigate to Azure AD, and find the application you configured for Moodle.</li>
        <li>Enable multitenancy in the Azure AD application and save changes.</li>
        <li>For each tenant you want to enable, click "Add New Tenant" and log in with an administrator account from the tenant you want to enable.</li>
        <li>Once you have added all the tenants you want, re-enable the OpenID Connect authentication plugin in Moodle.</li>
        <li>You're done! To add additional tenants in the future, just click the "Add New Tenant" button and log in with an administrator account from that tenant.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Important Note:</b> Azure AD multitenancy allows all Office 365 tenants to access your application when enabled.
